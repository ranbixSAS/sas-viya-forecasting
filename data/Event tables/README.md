# Event tables

We provided an event repository on GitHub that is open to external contributors so that event tables can be shared by users. For country specific holidays and lunar holidays, the creation of an events table can be a time-consuming process. Having a shared central repository would make it easy for VF users to share and reuse holidays as needed for their projects around the world.

1. This repository should contain examples and documentation.
2. The repository must be open to external contributors.
